05 - Third-Party API Final Challenge  
This project involved refactoring code in order to complete a daily planner/scheduler type app.

## Description

This webpage will allows a user to enter tasks that they need to complete or remember during their workday. The daily planner will save their input, and load their input as needed. It will also color code the timeblocks based on the current time of day.
